## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-20

First release. Two domain-neutral skills installable natively on Claude Code (via plugin marketplace) and Claude.ai (via Skills upload), with zero custom build steps.

### Added
- `ground-rules` skill — four discipline rules enforced together on every substantive task: (1) fact-grounding (every factual claim carries a source + searchable quote), (2) no fake-confidence hedging, (3) read the real source before answering, (4) deliver only what was asked. Each rule has a worked example; a "never does" tail closes the file.
- `actor-template` skill — the Goal / Input / Steps / Output / Constraints shape for any actor (Skill, slash command, or workflow). Demands every Step produce an observable result and forbids Knowledge bleed. Includes a PR-summary worked example and a copy-paste template.
- Plugin manifest (`core/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`) at v0.1.0.
- `README.md` with install paths for Claude Code and Claude.ai.
- `VERIFICATION.md` with V1 (install), V2 (description-match), V3 (behavior-change) probes plus the ~90% trigger-rate falsifiable threshold.
