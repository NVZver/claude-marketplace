# Changelog

All notable changes to the `core` plugin are documented here. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions follow [SemVer](https://semver.org/). The plugin's authoritative version lives in [`./.claude-plugin/plugin.json`](./.claude-plugin/plugin.json) — bump it in the same commit that adds the changelog entry.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-20

### Added
- `core/skills/tier-selector/SKILL.md` — Actor skill that classifies a task into T1/T2/T3 by applying Vision §4 boundary signals, then waits for human confirmation. Per `vision/specs/2026-05-20-lsa-v0.2.0-design.md` §4.1.
- `core/CLAUDE.md` — opt-in always-on fragment declaring both `ground-rules` and `tier-selector` as required pre-task invocations. Mirrors the always-on/on-demand split from `vision/VISION.md:106`.
- `core/tests/repo-anchored.md` — dogfood self-tests (4 `ground-rules` probes, 2 `actor-template` probes, 1 V3 behavior-comparison task) anchored in this repo as the source of truth. Complements `VERIFICATION.md` (generic, portable) with repo-specific probes whose expected answers can be checked against actual file content. (Previously listed under `[Unreleased]`; rolled into 0.2.0 release.)

### Changed
- `core/README.md` — adds `tier-selector` to "What's here" and adds a "Merge the CLAUDE.md fragment" install step.
- `core/VERIFICATION.md` — adds Probe C for `tier-selector` under V2.
- Plugin description in `core/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` extended to mention `tier-selector` (T1/T2/T3) chain-of-thought.

### Notes
- `core/registry` (the lazy-load map-not-territory skill) remains deferred to v0.3.0. `vision/VISION.md:177` notes Claude Code's per-component plugin discovery partially subsumes its role.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-20

First release. Two domain-neutral skills installable natively on Claude Code (via plugin marketplace) and Claude.ai (via Skills upload), with zero custom build steps.

### Added
- `ground-rules` skill — four discipline rules enforced together on every substantive task: (1) fact-grounding (every factual claim carries a source + searchable quote), (2) no fake-confidence hedging, (3) read the real source before answering, (4) deliver only what was asked. Each rule has a worked example; a "never does" tail closes the file.
- `actor-template` skill — the Goal / Input / Steps / Output / Constraints shape for any actor (Skill, slash command, or workflow). Demands every Step produce an observable result and forbids Knowledge bleed. Includes a PR-summary worked example and a copy-paste template.
- Plugin manifest (`core/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`) at v0.1.0.
- `README.md` with install paths for Claude Code and Claude.ai.
- `VERIFICATION.md` with V1 (install), V2 (description-match), V3 (behavior-change) probes plus the ~90% trigger-rate falsifiable threshold.
